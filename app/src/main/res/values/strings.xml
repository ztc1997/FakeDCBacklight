Note: The minimum screen brightness is the brightness value in HAL, not necessarily 0~100% for every model, for example, the Xiaomi Mi 12s is 0~50%, you can adjust the brightness to the minimum brightness without strobe, then check \"Current HAL Brightness\". I actually measured that the minimum brightness of Xiaomi Mi 12s is 7.99%, please test other models by yourself</string>
